excerpt: 'In this first study we investigate the Bjerknes Feedback (BF) in the tropical Atlantic in an ocean reanalysis and in the CMIP5 model ensemble. We find the BF active in ORA-S4, and quantify it in the climate models against the reanalysis. While the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on zonal wind stress and zonal wind stress on the thermocline depth are reproduced well in the models, the response of SST to the thermocline depth anomaly is lacking. Most models suffer from sever biases in the ocean structure, which results in too deep thermoclines. This severly dampens the ability of thermocline anomalies to influence SST.'
