excerpt: 'In this study we tested the effect of enhanced vertical ocean mixing on the tropical Atlantic warm sea surface temperature (SST) bias, and biases related to the SST bias. We find that increased vertical mixing efficiency reduces the SST bias in the cold tongue region, where the thermocline is shallow and warm biases are strong. Associated biases such as marine precipitation are reduced. We then continued the model simulation into the 21st century and find that the climate change signal depends on the ocean vertical mixing parameterization.'

In this paper we investigate the effect of enhanced ocean vertical mixing parameterization on present day and future climate in the tropical Atlantic. Insufficient vertical mixing has long been suspected to be at the root of sea surface temperature related biases. Here, we follow up on the result obtained with the atmosphere-ocean single column model and test the parameterization enhancement in a coupled global climate model. We show that sea surface temperature related biases are reduced in size, and that the projected future climate shows sensitivity to the mixing parameterization.
