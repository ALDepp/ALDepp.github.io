excerpt: 'In this study we investigate the sea surface temperature (SST) evolution in the southeastern tropical Atlantic with a single column model (SCM). We demonstrate that the SCM develops a warm bias similar to that of the three dimensional host model EC-Earth, and that this bias can largely be reduced by enhancing the vertical mixing efficieny within the physically possible range. Reducing the atmospheric biases (and therefore improve surface fluxes into the ocean) reduces the SST bias by 40%, while enhancing the vertical mixing efficiency can reduce the bias by 70%.'

In this paper we investigate the long-standing southeastern tropical Atlantic warm sea surface temperature (SST) bias with a novel coupled atmosphere-ocean single column model (SCM). We focus on boreal summer, in which the tropical Atlantic cold tongue develops rapidly. The observed cooling cannot be matched in coupled global climate models, which leads to a warm bias. The SCM produces a very similar bias 5 days into the simulation. We find that by nudging the atmosphere to reanalysis we reduce the bias by 40%. This is is a sizeable reduction, but we can do even better than that. By increasing the efficiency with which available turbulent kinetic energy in the ocean leads to ocean vertical mixing we reduce the warm SST bias by 70%. This result is robust whether we leave the atmosphere to evolve freely or nudge to reanalysis.
