Hi!

I am Anna, a physical oceanographer and climate scientist with a focus on the tropics. Currently I am working in the [Ocean Section of the Climate and Global Dynamics Lab at NCAR](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/oce/?ref=hp) on partitioning upwelling in the eastern tropical Pacific into adiabatic and diabatic processes as part of the Pacific Upwelling and Mixing Physics (PUMP) project. We achieve this by leveraging the water mass transformation framework, which further allows us to determine what drives the adiabatic flow. Stay tuned for our first publication, which is currently in preparation. 

During my PhD at [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Environmental-Sciences/Meteorology-and-Air-Quality-Group.htm) and the [Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute](https://www.knmi.nl/research/weather-climate-models) I investigated the warm sea surface temperature bias in the tropical Atlantic which is common to most state-of-the-art coupled global climate models as part of the [European Union 7th framework project PREFACE](https://preface.w.uib.no/). You can read more about [what we found in the publications section](https://aldepp.github.io/publications/).
